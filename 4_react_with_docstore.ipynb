He is not lost in\\nrapture at the great works of Phidias, the Parthenon, the Propylea, the\\nstatues of Zeus or Athene. He would probably have regarded any abstract\\ntruth of number  or Ô¨Ågure as higher than the greatest of them. Yet it is hard\\nto suppose that some inÔ¨Çuence, such as he hopes to inspire in youth, did not\\npass into his own mind from the works of art which he saw around him.

But in Plato this feeling has no expression; he\\nnowhere says that beauty is the object of art; he seems to deny that wisdom\\ncan take an external form (Phaedrus); he does not distinguish the Ô¨Åne from\\nthe mechanical arts. Whether or no, like some writers, he felt more than he\\nexpressed, it is at any rate remarkable that the greatest perfection of the Ô¨Åne\\narts should coincide with an almost entire silence about them. In one very\\nstriking passage he tells us that a work of art, like the State, is a whole; and\\nthis conception of a whole and the love of the newly-born mathematical\\nsciences may be regarded, if not as the inspiring, at any rate as the\\nregulating principles of Greek art (Xen.

But the judge ought to have had no similar experience of evil; he is\\nto be a good man who, having passed his youth in innocence, became\\nacquainted late in life with the vices of others.

Dubbed the \"Founder of\\nModern Philoso phy\", and the \"Father of Modern Mathematics\", much of\\nsubsequent western philosophy is a reaction to his writings, which have\\nbeen closely studied from his time down to the present day. His inÔ¨Çuence in\\nmathematics is also apparent, the Cartesian coordinate system being used in\\nplane geometry and algebra being named after him, and he was one of the\\nkey Ô¨Ågures in the ScientiÔ¨Åc Revolution. Descartes frequently contrasted his\\nviews with those of his predecessors. In the opening section of the Passions\\nof the Soul, a treatise on the Early Modern version of what are now\\ncommonly called emotions, he goes so far as to assert that he will write on\\nhis topic  \"as if no one had written on these matters before\". Nevertheless\\nmany elements of his philosoph y have precedents in late Aristotelianism,\\nthe revived Stoicism of the 16th century , or in earlier philosophers like St.\\nAugustine. In his natural philosophy , he differs from the Scho ols on two\\nmajor points: Ô¨Årst, he rejects the analysis of corporeal substance into matter\\nand form; second, he rejects any appeal to ends‚Äîdivine or natural‚Äîin\\nexplaining natur al phenomena. In his theology , he insists on the absolute\\nfreedom of God‚Äô s act of creation. Descartes was a major Ô¨Ågure in 17th\\ncentury continental rationalism, later advocated by Baruch Spinoza and\\nGottfried Leibniz, and oppos ed by the empiricist school of thought\\nconsisting of Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley , and Hume. Leibniz, Spinoza and\\nDescartes were  all versed in mathematics as well as philo sophy , and\\nDescartes and Leibniz contrib uted greatly to science as well. As the\\ninventor of the Cartesian coordinate system, Descartes founded analytic\\ngeometry , that bridge between algebra and geometry crucial to the invention\\nof calculus and analysis. Descartes\\'s reÔ¨Çections on mind and mechanism\\nbegan the strain of western thought that much later, impelled by the\\ninvention of the electronic computer and by the possibility of machine\\nintelligence, blossomed into, e.g., the Turing test. His most famous\\nstatement is: Cogito ergo sum (French: Je pense, donc je suis; English: I\\nthink, therefore I am), found in ¬ß7 of part I of Principles of Philosophy\\n(Latin) and in part IV of Discourse on the Method (French).

But when, after having arrived at the idea of good, which is the\\nend of the scienc e of dialectic, he is asked, What is the nature, and what are\\nthe divis ions of the science? He refuses to answer , as if inten ding by the\\nrefusal to intima te that the state of knowledge which then existed was not\\nsuch as would allow the philosopher to enter into his Ô¨Ånal rest. The previous\\nsciences must Ô¨Årst be studied, and will, we may add, continue to be studied\\ntell the end of time, although in a sense different from any which Plato\\ncould have conceived. But we may observe, that while he is aware of the\\nvacancy of his own ideal, he is full of enthusiasm in the contemp lation of it.\\nLooking into the orb of light,  he sees nothing, but he is warmed and\\nelevated. The Hebrew prophet believed that faith in God would  enable him\\nto govern the world; the Greek philosopher imagined that contemplation of\\nthe good would make a legislator . There is as much to be Ô¨Ålled up in the one\\ncase as in the other , and the one mode of conception is to the Israelite what\\nthe other is to the Greek.

Is God above or below the idea of good?\\nOr is the Idea of Good another mode of conceiving God? The latter appears\\nto be the truer answer . To the Greek philosopher the perfection and unity of\\nGod was a far higher concept ion than his personality , which he hardly\\nfound a word to express, and which to him would have seemed to be\\nborrowed from mythology . To the Christian, on the other hand, or to the\\nmodern thinker in general, it is difÔ¨Åcult, if not impossible, to attach reality\\nto what he terms mere abstractio n; while to Plato this very abstraction is the\\ntruest and most  real of all things.

This is my parable; which I will beg you to interpret for\\nme to those gentlemen who ask why the philosopher has such an evil name,\\nand to explain to them that not he, but those who will not use him, are to\\nblame for his uselessness. The philosopher should not beg of mankind to be\\nput in authority over them. The wise man should not seek the rich, as the\\nproverb bids, but every man, whether rich or poor, must knock at the door\\nof the physician when he has need of him. Now the pilot is the philosopher\\n‚Äîhe whom in the parable they call star-gazer , and the mutinous sailors are\\nthe mob of politicians by whom he is rendered useless. Not that these are\\nthe worst enemies of philosophy , who is far more dishonoured by her own\\nprofessing sons when they are corrupted by the world. Need I recall the\\noriginal image of the philosophe r? Did we not say of him just now, that he\\nloved truth and hated falsehood, and that he could not rest in the\\nmultiplicity of phenomena, but was led by a sympathy in his own nature to\\nthe contemplation of the absolute? All the virtues as well as truth, who is\\nthe leader of them, took up their abode in his soul.

He is not lost in\\nrapture at the great works of Phidias, the Parthenon, the Propylea, the\\nstatues of Zeus or Athene. He would probably have regarded any abstract\\ntruth of number  or Ô¨Ågure as higher than the greatest of them.

Dubbed the \"Founder of\\nModern Philoso phy\", and the \"Father of Modern Mathematics\", much of\\nsubsequent western philosophy is a reaction to his writings, which have\\nbeen closely studied from his time down to the present day. His inÔ¨Çuence in\\nmathematics is also apparent, the Cartesian coordinate system being used in\\nplane geometry and algebra being named after him, and he was one of the\\nkey Ô¨Ågures in the ScientiÔ¨Åc Revolution. Descartes frequently contrasted his\\nviews with those of his predecessors. In the opening section of the Passions\\nof the Soul, a treatise on the Early Modern version of what are now\\ncommonly called emotions, he goes so far as to assert that he will write on\\nhis topic  \"as if no one had written on these matters before\". Nevertheless\\nmany elements of his philosoph y have precedents in late Aristotelianism,\\nthe revived Stoicism of the 16th century , or in earlier philosophers like St.\\nAugustine. In his natural philosophy , he differs from the Scho ols on two\\nmajor points: Ô¨Årst, he rejects the analysis of corporeal substance into matter\\nand form; second, he rejects any appeal to ends‚Äîdivine or natural‚Äîin\\nexplaining natur al phenomena. In his theology , he insists on the absolute\\nfreedom of God‚Äô s act of creation. Descartes was a major Ô¨Ågure in 17th\\ncentury continental rationalism, later advocated by Baruch Spinoza and\\nGottfried Leibniz, and oppos ed by the empiricist school of thought\\nconsisting of Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley , and Hume. Leibniz, Spinoza and\\nDescartes were  all versed in mathematics as well as philo sophy , and\\nDescartes and Leibniz contrib uted greatly to science as well. As the\\ninventor of the Cartesian coordinate system, Descartes founded analytic\\ngeometry , that bridge between algebra and geometry crucial to the invention\\nof calculus and analysis. Descartes\\'s reÔ¨Çections on mind and mechanism\\nbegan the strain of western thought that much later, impelled by the\\ninvention of the electronic computer and by the possibility of machine\\nintelligence, blossomed into, e.g., the Turing test. His most famous\\nstatement is: Cogito ergo sum (French: Je pense, donc je suis; English: I\\nthink, therefore I am), found in ¬ß7 of part I of Principles of Philosophy\\n(Latin) and in part IV of Discourse on the Method (French).

But when, after having arrived at the idea of good, which is the\\nend of the scienc e of dialectic, he is asked, What is the nature, and what are\\nthe divis ions of the science? He refuses to answer , as if inten ding by the\\nrefusal to intima te that the state of knowledge which then existed was not\\nsuch as would allow the philosopher to enter into his Ô¨Ånal rest. The previous\\nsciences must Ô¨Årst be studied, and will, we may add, continue to be studied\\ntell the end of time, although in a sense different from any which Plato\\ncould have conceived. But we may observe, that while he is aware of the\\nvacancy of his own ideal, he is full of enthusiasm in the contemp lation of it.\\nLooking into the orb of light,  he sees nothing, but he is warmed and\\nelevated. The Hebrew prophet believed that faith in God would  enable him\\nto govern the world; the Greek philosopher imagined that contemplation of\\nthe good would make a legislator . There is as much to be Ô¨Ålled up in the one\\ncase as in the other , and the one mode of conception is to the Israelite what\\nthe other is to the Greek. Both Ô¨Ånd a repose in a divine perfection, which,\\nwhether in a more personal or impersonal form, exists without them and\\nindependently of them, as well as within them.\\nThere is no mention of the idea of good in the Timaeus, nor of the divine\\nCreator of the world in the Republic; and we are naturally led to ask in what\\nrelation they stand to one anothe r. Is God above or below the idea of good?\\nOr is the Idea of Good another mode of conceiving God? The latter appears\\nto be the truer answer . To the Greek philosopher the perfection and unity of\\nGod was a far higher concept ion than his personality , which he hardly\\nfound a word to express, and which to him would have seemed to be\\nborrowed from mythology . To the Christian, on the other hand, or to the\\nmodern thinker in general, it is difÔ¨Åcult, if not impossible, to attach reality\\nto what he terms mere abstractio n; while to Plato this very abstraction is the\\ntruest and most  real of all things. Hence, from a difference in forms of\\nthought, Plato appears to be resting on a creation of his own mind only. But\\nif we may be allowed to paraphrase the idea of good by the words\\n'intelligent principle of law and order in the universe, embracing equally\\nman and nature,' we begin to Ô¨Ånd a meeting-point between him and\\nourselves.\", metadata={'source': 'books/plato-the-republic.pdf', 'page': 178}), Document(page_content=\"admission reconcileable with the doctrine that philosophers should be\\nkings?'\\nI shall answer you in a parable  which will also let you see how poor a\\nhand I am at the invention of allegories. The relation of good men to their\\ngovernments is so peculiar , that in order to defend them I must take an\\nillustration from the world of Ô¨Åction. Conceive the captain of a ship, taller\\nby a head and shoulders than any of the crew , yet a little deaf, a little blind,\\nand rather ignor ant of the seam an's art. The sailors want to steer, although\\nthey know nothing of the art; and they have a theory that it cannot be\\nlearned. If the helm is refused them, they drug the captain's posset, bind him\\nhand and foot, and take possess ion of the ship. He who joins in the mutiny\\nis termed a good pilot and what not; they have no conception that the true\\npilot must observe the winds and the stars, and must be their master ,\\nwhether they like it or not;‚Äîsuch an one would be called by them fool,\\nprater , star-gazer . This is my parable; which I will beg you to interpret for\\nme to those gentlemen who ask why the philosopher has such an evil name,\\nand to explain to them that not he, but those who will not use him, are to\\nblame for his uselessness. The philosopher should not beg of mankind to be\\nput in authority over them. The wise man should not seek the rich, as the\\nproverb bids, but every man, whether rich or poor, must knock at the door\\nof the physician when he has need of him. Now the pilot is the philosopher\\n‚Äîhe whom in the parable they call star-gazer , and the mutinous sailors are\\nthe mob of politicians by whom he is rendered useless. Not that these are\\nthe worst enemies of philosophy , who is far more dishonoured by her own\\nprofessing sons when they are corrupted by the world. Need I recall the\\noriginal image of the philosophe r? Did we not say of him just now, that he\\nloved truth and hated falsehood, and that he could not rest in the\\nmultiplicity of phenomena, but was led by a sympathy in his own nature to\\nthe contemplation of the absolute? All the virtues as well as truth, who is\\nthe leader of them, took up their abode in his soul. But as you were\\nobserving, if we turn aside to view the reality , we see that the persons who\\nwere thus described, with the exception of a small and useless class, are\\nutter rogues.\\nThe point which has to be considered, is the origin of this corruption in\\nnature. Every one will admit that the philosopher , in our descrip tion of him,\\nis a rare being.  But what numberless causes tend to destroy these rare\\nbeings!
